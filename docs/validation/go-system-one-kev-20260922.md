# Kev comparison for Go System One

The comparison uses `jaredpalmer/kev` at commit `90990a5fac2995b9faa3190f7d437e84f2067768`. Kev supplies a useful decision-model and evaluation reference. Its runtime and model contract do not replace Go System One's native Gemma 4 GGUF path.

## Systems compared

| Area | Go System One v1 | Kev |
|---|---|---|
| Model | Pinned Gemma 4 12B IT GGUF | Qwen3.5 0.8B, 4B and 9B bases with rank-16 LoRA and a pointer head |
| Readout | Constrained next-token logits over JSON boolean and string-enum paths | Dot product between each option's `</opt>` hidden state and the question's `<decide>` hidden state |
| Runtime | Native Go, CPU/SIMD oracle and NVIDIA Driver API with embedded PTX | Python, PyTorch, Transformers and PEFT; optional `flash-linear-attention` |
| Precision and storage | Quantised GGUF; accepted RTX 3060 projection residency is 9,173,277,696 bytes | bf16 serving; no implemented quantised or GGUF path |
| API | `POST /v1/decision` over 1–256 contexts; boolean and enum fields | TypeSafe-compatible `POST /v1/systemone`; `noul`, `choice` and ordered `score` questions |
| Parallel unit | Many contexts and field candidate tries share a rendered schema prefix | Many questions share one state; sibling questions cannot read each other |
| Cache | Shared schema prompt and device-resident KV ownership | LRU cache of repeated state prefixes; four entries of at least 384 tokens by default |
| Admission | One active request; strict bounded validation and cancellation | One active request; state plus question may use up to 8,192 tokens at inference |

Kev's pointer head changes the learned model. It cannot be applied to the pinned Gemma 4 Go System One checkpoint as an inference-only optimisation. A separate Kev checkpoint port can reuse go-pherence's existing native Qwen3.5 DeltaNet runtime, LoRA loader and prefix-state machinery; the [upstream Kev porting roadmap](https://github.com/rcarmo/go-pherence/blob/8629232b14440f4a9aa06cfb6d6003c1302c8cb9/docs/models/kev-porting-roadmap.md) defines that work.

## Kev techniques relevant to Go System One

### Adopted: reject forged control delimiters

Kev rewrites caller strings before tokenisation so they cannot produce its five delimiter tokens. Go System One renders caller contexts, instructions and schema text inside a Gemma chat template. The Gemma tokenizer recognises strings such as `<|turn>` and `<turn|>` as added special tokens.

Go System One now asks tokenizers that implement `UserTextValidator` to validate the complete caller-controlled schema, instructions and contexts before prompt compilation. The native tokenizer rejects configured special-token strings. Trusted Go System One template delimiters still use normal tokenisation, so ordinary requests and the pinned parity fixture retain the same token IDs.

### Already present

- Shared-prefix KV reuse and independent branch execution.
- Packed execution of independent suffix work on the native NVIDIA path.
- Candidate-only output projection. Kev avoids the vocabulary head entirely; Go System One projects only the candidate vocabulary rows needed by its constrained decoder.
- Deterministic validation, bounded candidate counts and a single-request admission gate.
- A playground and explicit comparisons of packed and separate execution. Go System One's CPU/SIMD and pinned llama.cpp gates cover numerical parity instead of Kev's packed-versus-row equivalence test.

### Useful future API and quality work

- Add an ordered-score schema type only with a precise response contract. Kev returns the expected zero-based level plus the full probability distribution.
- Add an option-order sensitivity endpoint or benchmark. Kev's `/v1/systemone/permute` exposes answer changes caused by reordering options.
- Evaluate probability calibration on labelled Go System One data. Kev stores a fitted checkpoint temperature and reports Brier score, calibration error, confident errors and automation coverage at a fixed error budget. Go System One probabilities are constrained model probabilities and are not calibrated accuracy estimates.
- Add repeated-context caching only after measurement. Kev caches state prefixes because its schema varies while the state repeats. Go System One currently caches the schema prefix because one request carries many contexts; a state LRU helps a different workload and retains substantial KV memory.

## Performance evidence

Kev reports five-question latency in the tens of milliseconds on H100 and MI300X when Qwen3.5 uses `flash-linear-attention`. It does not publish an RTX 3060 result. Its model cards report about 9 GB for Kev-4B bf16 and 19 GB for Kev-9B bf16; the latter cannot fit this project's 12 GB target. Apple M5 bf16 medians are 329 ms for 0.8B, 779 ms for 4B and about 2 seconds for 9B on a roughly 230-token state.

These measurements use different models, precision, hardware, state length and question count from Go System One's 80.65 ms median Gemma 4 request on an RTX 3060. They do not support a direct speed comparison or a Go System One runtime change.

## Licence and checkpoint scope

Kev source, adapters and pointer heads use Apache-2.0. The named Qwen3 and Qwen3.5 base models are also Apache-2.0. Each training dataset keeps its own licence, listed in the Kev model cards. Go System One's independent playground can use Kev's published API and evaluation ideas without importing its code. Any copied implementation must retain Apache-2.0 notices and track dataset terms separately.
